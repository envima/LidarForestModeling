# LidarForestModeling :evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree:	:evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree:	


Comparison of successional stages models using Sentinel-2 and LiDAR variables vs models using just Sentinel-2 variables. Modeled using random forest, spatial validation and forward feature selection using [CAST](https://hannameyer.github.io/CAST/). Study area is Rhineland-Palatinate.

A preprint of this study is currently available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/nqfvh)

### Data
Data from five different sources were used for this study. A vector polygon was used to delineate the study area, a forest mask showing the forest areas in the study area and Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data as environmental variables as well as forest inventory data as a response variable.
